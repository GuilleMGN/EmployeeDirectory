# EmployeeDirectory

## User Story
* AS a user, I WANT TO be able to view my entire employee directory at once SO THAT I have quick access to their information.

## Description
This application is an employee directory that works with React. It displays a list of employees and their personal information, including profile image, name, phone, email, and age; all info is from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=200&nat=us). The application has a search box where the user can input any details of an employee, and the table of employees will filter and return the matching employees to the users search term. They also have options sort the employees by name and age (in ascending and descending order). As mentioned before, this application uses React, which requires the UI components to be broken up in order to manage the component's state and respond to user events efficiently. The site is deployed to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)
